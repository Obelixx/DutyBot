# Duty Bot

This is a chat bot for Microsoft Teams build during the hackathon: **[HackTogether: The Microsoft Teams Global Hack](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together-teams)**

It is a simple bot designed to help in a group chat or a team in side Microsoft Teams app. It can keep (in-memory for now) a schedule of duties. And when a keyword is detected in the chat it will check the schedule and plug in the conversation.
